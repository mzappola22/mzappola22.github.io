When you got hit you would have to stay on the side of the other team and try to get them out. The more people who get out the more likeley you will lose.</p>

                <p class="lead">Today we worked on designing things with the 3D printer. We also got to make robot cockroaches, play with the vr and 3d camera, play with the Little Bits, and play with robots. I attatched some videos to watch about that. I got to ride a rollercoaster with the google cardboard. It felt like i was moving but wasnt moving at the same time. When I used the 360 degree camera I took photos and made funny faces at the camera. When I played with the Oculus Rift VR I played with a drawing game. I think in the future people will be usoing VR headsets to build plans for houses. I also had a chance to play with the robots. One called Nao could stand up, feel stuff. and dance. I also used a robot called Anki Cozmo that had pace detection and could play games. When I used the little Bits I hooked up some of the magnetic pieces and made an alarm with touch sense and a fan. I also made something that could detect temperature. The best part was when we used the Soldering machine to make a solar panel controlled cockroach. The Soldering machine was 700 degrees Farenheight and could instantly melt metal.</p>

                <p class="lead"> Alex Deleva and I are making a floating tray with light material and a homemade drone. 
                * We are making this to try and make them more popular and change the world

                * This has been done before by some people

                * We will need 4 propeller balls, styrofoam, light wood, and woodcutting tools.

                * We will be making this with these steps:
                1. Cut vents in wood 
                2. Glue propeller balls to styrofoam
                3. glue homemade drone (styrofoam and propeller balls) to wood
                4. put food on it and watch it fly!

                <p class="lead"> Monday Feb 26, 2018:

                  Today in Innovation lab, we got to use the Oculus Rift and Samsung VR. The virtual reality experience was amazing and felt so real but after a while made me dizzy. I then used the Oculus Rift to paint with Tilt brush. With the Tilt Brush app, You can paint anything. The painting on this app and the painting in reallife are very different. Painting in Tilt Brush is 3D and has many more features that make it easy to paint and erase. After playing with the VR, we played with a 360 degree camera. We got to make fun videos with it. When we all used the camera we immideatley noticed something. The lens for it looks like a fish eye lens and can see everything near it. We could put our videos into VR's and see everything in the area. The three VR headset's that we used were the Google Cardboards, Gear VR's, and the Oculus Rift. The Cardboard is a basic VR that you put your phone in. The Gear VR is similar to that but strictly for Samsung phones which are built to do VR. The Oculus Rift is a very advanced VR that is connected to your computer. The Oculus has many games that you can use it for and also has the ability to use your hands while you are playing. VR is just developing and isn't perfect yet. In the near future I would expect the quality of the VR and the ability to fit it on your head will improve. VR's will probably get smaller and maybe become accessories to everyday life.
